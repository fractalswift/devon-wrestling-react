<h2>About Devon Wrestling:</h2>

<p>
Devon UK is considered the birthplace of many Catch Wrestling techniques which are now a part of modern submission wrestling. This timer will be used for modern Devon Wrestling matches. Points are scored by time-in-control. For example, one second of 'side control' equals one point to the controlling fighter. Points are only taken into consideration if neither fighter is able to submit the other before the time limit is up.
